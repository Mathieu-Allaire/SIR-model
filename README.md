# SIR-model

In this project, a colleague and I modelled the spread of an infectious disease by implementing the SIR model in Python and visualizing the progression through matplotlib. We tested the spreads at different vaccination rates (1%, 5%) and by choosing to include or not the possibility of mortality and re-susceptibility of patients. With this, we were able to demonstrate the effects these different factors have on pandemics and disease outbreaks, which is no doubt incredibly important now that we have started experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic.
