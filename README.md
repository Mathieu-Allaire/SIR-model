# SIR-model

In this project, a colleague and I modelled the spread of an infectious disease by implementing the SIR model in Python and visualizing the progression through matplotlib. We tested the spreads at different vaccination rates (1%, 5%) and by choosing to include or not the possibility of mortality and re-susceptibility of patients. With this, we were able to demonstrate the effects these different factors have on pandemics and disease outbreaks, which is no doubt incredibly important now that we have started experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Recommended IDE Setup
Any IDE that supports Python can run the code as long as the modules math and matplotlib are correctly installed beforehand.

For an easy visualization of the code, I recommend using [Google Collab](https://colab.google/), a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use while providing access free of charge to computing resources including GPUs.
